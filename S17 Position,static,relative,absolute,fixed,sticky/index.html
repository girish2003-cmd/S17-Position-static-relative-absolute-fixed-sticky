<h2>India Men's Cricket Team History</h2>
<p> India played their first Test match, against England at Lord's, in 1932, but it took over 70 years for them to truly come into their own as a force in cricket: they developed into one of the game's powerhouses under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and especially Virat Kohli, in the second decade of the 21st century.

    Sunil Gavaskar, perhaps India's first world-beating batter, who was the first to the 10,000-run milestone in Tests, came along in the early 1970s. Kapil Dev, an allrounder who ranked with the world's best, and India's finest since spinner-batter Vinoo Mankad in the 1940s, broke through later that decade.
    
    Fan following for the sport in the country surged in the years following their fairy-tale first ODI World Cup win, in 1983, and by the late 1990s, India was the world's biggest cricket market, and the money from the sale of TV rights to grab the attention of its hundreds of millions of fans had begun in large part to call the shots in the game.
    
    The rise of Sachin Tendulkar, a world-record-setting superstar batter like none in the game before him, helped underline the country's growing stature in cricket. Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, and a little later Virender Sehwag, were the lynchpins of a golden age of Indian batting in the 2000s.
    
    As a Test side India have been close to unbeatable at home for over 35 years, having lost only three full home series since 1987. In the 1990s it was their spinners - India's greatest match-winner, Anil Kumble, and a support cast - who gave them home advantage. In the second half of the 2010s and after, India also produced excellent fast bowlers (Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and others) to become one of the most formidable teams in Test cricket, home and away.
    
    They went 11 Test series without a loss from 2008-09, won two Test series on the bounce in Australia starting 2018-19, and got to the final of the World Test Championship in both of the first two cycles of that tournament.
    
    In limited-overs cricket India have been somewhat less consistent. After a minor purple patch in the 1980s, they next had a good run when they secured ICC white-ball tournament wins in 2007, 2011 and 2013.
    
    The most significant development in Indian cricket over the last half-century has probably been the birth and success of the Indian Premier League, the most lucrative and most competitive T20 league in the world, which kicked off in 2008.</p>
<h2>South Africa Men's Cricket Team History</h2>
<p>
    South Africa were the third country to play international cricket after England and Australia, in 1889, but had a tough start. It was 17 years before they won a Test and almost 70 before they were regularly beating their opposition. The mid to late 1960s, a time when Graeme Pollock, Eddie Barlow, Mike Procter and Ali Bacher were in action, marked a first golden age, albeit one that excluded South Africa's majority population.

South Africa was isolated for two decades on account of apartheid, and when they returned to cricket in 1991, the game had expanded and changed to include white-ball cricket. South Africa soon proved a competitive force in shorter formats and have reached five ODI World Cup and two T20 World Cup semi-finals, but are yet to win either title.

Their biggest successes have been in Tests, in which they were undefeated in away series from 2007 to 2015 - towards the end of which period they became the the No. 1-ranked side in the world. In 2012, Hashim Amla became the first South African to hit a Test triple-century as South Africa beat England in England - the high-water mark of Graeme Smith's captaincy.

Smith is the most successful Test captain in history, with more wins (53) than any other, while Jacques Kallis is among the game's greatest allrounders, having made more than 10,000 Test runs and taken over 250 wickets in both Tests and ODIs.

South Africa have always had a strong fast-bowling core, from the time of Shaun Pollock to Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada. And in the 21st century they produced a batter who revolutionised the craft with his 360-degree approach to strokeplay: AB de Villiers.

On-field success came against the background of administrative turmoil in the 2000s. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, CSA circled through several CEOs, and a painful Social Justice and Nation-Building process, to better understand the impact of racism and discrimination on the game. A target system remains in place in order to achieve a more representative team.
